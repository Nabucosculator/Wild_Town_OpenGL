# Wild Town – OpenGL 3D Graphics Project

## Overview
**Wild Town** is a real-time 3D graphics project developed using **OpenGL**, showcasing a fully rendered scene with interactive camera movement and multiple visual effects. The project focuses on core computer graphics concepts and real-time rendering techniques.

## What the project represents
The scene represents a small 3D environment ("Wild Town") designed to demonstrate how a modern OpenGL application is structured and how graphical effects are implemented at a low level.  
It is intended as a **computer graphics academic project**, emphasizing understanding rather than using external engines.

## Main features
- Real-time 3D rendering using OpenGL
- Free camera movement and scene navigation
- Multiple light sources (directional, point, spotlight)
- Shadow mapping
- Fog effects
- Skybox environment
- Textured 3D models
- Keyboard-based interaction and toggles
- Basic collision handling

## Technologies used
- C++
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW
- GLM
- Custom GLSL shaders

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate:
- understanding of the OpenGL rendering pipeline
- usage of shaders for lighting and effects
- transformation matrices and camera logic
- real-time interaction in a 3D environment

## Controls
The scene can be explored using keyboard and mouse controls defined in the source code, allowing movement, camera rotation and toggling of visual effects.

## Notes
This project does not rely on any external game engine. All rendering logic, effects and interactions are implemented manually using OpenGL and GLSL.
